    ### Determine connections between stops

    Our next main goal is to detect the **frequency of a direct public transport connections** from one stop to another. In the end, we would like every stop `s` in our graph to contain relationships of the form `(s)-[:X_CONNECTS_TO]->(t)` for every stop `t` it has a _direct_ connection to at least once per year, where `X` is replaced by the mode of transport ($X \in \{\texttt{BUS}, \texttt{TRAM}, \texttt{SUBWAY}\}$).

    For that, we first calculate an approximation of the number of times a single trip is operated per year: 
    ```cypher
    MATCH (s:Service)
    // Calculate (approximately) how many times a year the trip is operated regularly
    WITH s,
        s.monday + s.tuesday + s.wednesday + s.thursday + s.friday + s.saturday + s.sunday AS days_per_week,
        duration.inDays(s.start_date, s.end_date).days + 1 AS operational_days
    WITH s,
        toInteger(ceil((operational_days / 7.0) * days_per_week)) as regular_operations_per_year
    // If there are some exceptions to the schedule, subtract them
    OPTIONAL MATCH (s)<-[:FOR_SERVICE]-(ex:ServiceException:RemovedService)

    // Store the result in a property of each schedule node
    SET s.operations_per_year = regular_operations_per_year - removed_days;
    ```

    The value obtained by this query is not the exact number of trips in the year 2024, since it only considers the number of weeks in a year instead of the exact number of Mondays, Tuesdays, etc. in the year 2024. However, the numbers should be within roughly $2\%$ of the true value and basically represent a year-on-year average for each trip.

    Note that such trips do not necessarily move between the exact stops $s1$ and $s2$ but between two stops within their (separate) clusters, as we have previously moved all `:AT_STOP` relationships to a cluster's root node.

    To determine a fine-grained level of service, we differentiate between modes of transport (bus, tram, subway) when creating these connection relationships, and we also store the exact number of operations per year for that connection in the `yearly` property of that relationship.

    ```

    A quick word about the `WHERE` clause:

    - `s1.id <> s2.id` -- This guarantees that we ignore trips within a cluster to prevent overcounting, since our bundling of stops may have lead to sequential stops being part of the same cluster (and thus the `:AT_STOP` relationship was redirected to the same root node) .
