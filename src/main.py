However, these constraints might consider some stops (exits/platforms) separate that officially belong to the same station but are particularly far apart.

    ### Merging hierarchichally related stops

    Luckily, the Wiener Linien used somewhat of a hierarchichal structure when assigning unique IDs to their stops. In particular, the IDs consist of five components delimited by a colon, where the last (fifth) component denotes the respective exit/platform of a station. Using these semantics, we can further improve our stop clustering and stitch together all platforms/exits of each station.
