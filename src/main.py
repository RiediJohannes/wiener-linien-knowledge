    This bundles lots of stops that are geographically very close to each other, while still enforcing some upper limits on the diameter of such clusters to prevent the formation of long chains. However, these constraints might still rip apart some stations whose individual exits or platforms are particularly far apart.

    Luckily, the Wiener Linien used somewhat of a hierarchichal structure when assigning unique IDs to their stops. In particular, the IDs consist of five components delimited by a colon, where the last (fifth) component denotes the respective exit/platform of a station. Using these semantics, we can further improve our stop clustering and stitch together all platforms/exits of each station.

    ## Matching stops to districts
    Our next goal is to match each stop to Viennese registration districts they serve.  
    First, let's delete stops entirely that are located outside the Vienna city boundary. Most notably, this includes many stops of the _Badner Bahn_ that reach all the way to _Baden bei Wien_.

    This is a simple task by relying again on the semantics of the stop IDs. Stops whose ID starts with `at:49` are within Vienna whereas stops with `at:43` at the beginning of their ID are located outside Vienna. Thus, we find and delete the latter.
