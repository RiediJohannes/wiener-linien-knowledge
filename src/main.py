    Next, we find every pair of stops $(s1, s2)$ such that some trip $t$ directly connects $s1$ to $s2$ (in that order). We aggregate over all such trips $t$ and sum their operations per year to get the total number of direct connections $s1 \to s2$ in a year.  
    Note that such trips do not necessarily move between the exact stops $s1$ and $s2$ but between two stops within their (separate) clusters, as we have previously moved all `:STOPS_AT` relationships to a cluster's root node.

    To determine a fine-grained level of service, we differentiate between modes of transport (bus, tram, subway) when creating these connection relationships, and we also store the exact number of operations per year for that connection in the `yearly` property of that relationship.

    ```cypher
    // Consider each pair of stops that appears consecutively in some trip t
    MATCH (t:Trip:{type_of_trip})-[at1:STOPS_AT]->(s1:Stop),
          (t)-[at2:STOPS_AT]->(s2:Stop)
    WHERE s1.id <> s2.id AND at2.stop_sequence = at1.stop_sequence + 1
    // Grab the unique Service connected to each trip t and sum up the yearly operations of all trips through s1 -> s2
    MATCH (t)-[:OPERATING_ON]->(service:Service)
    WITH s1, s2,
      sum(service.operations_per_year) as total_operations_per_year
    // Create a connection relationship with the number of connections per year
    MERGE (s1)-[conn:$type_of_connection]->(s2)
    SET conn.yearly = total_operations_per_year
    ```
    Just be sure to replace the variable `$type_of_trip` and `$type_of_connection` with the correct labels for the respective mode of transport.

    A quick word about the `WHERE` clause:

    - `s1.id <> s2.id` -- This guarantees that we ignore trips within a cluster to prevent overcounting, since our bundling of stops may have lead to sequential stops being part of the same cluster (and thus the `:STOPS_AT` relationship was redirected to the same root node) .
    - `st2.stop_sequence = st1.stop_sequence + 1` -- This ensures that we only consider _direct_ connections between stops.

    # Knowledge Graph Embeddings

    Now, we are ready for this project's main goal, which is predicting missing connections in Vienna's public transport network. As the wording suggests, this becomes a classic **link prediction problem** in our knowledge graph. A key tool to tackle such problems are knowledge graph embeddings. In this chapter, we will use the popular KG embedding library **PyKEEN**.

    ## Training Triples Generation

    Since link prediction works on the basis of **triples** of the form $(h,r,t)$ ($h:$ head, $r:$ relation, $t:$ tail), we need to derive and extract meaningful triples from our knowledge graph. This training data should include all reasonable information about the domain that is considered relevant for planning new transport connections between existing stops.

    ### Existing Transit Network

    ```cypher
    {triples_queries["Existing transit connections"]}
    ```

    We exclude connections that happen fewer than four times a day (<1460 times a year) on average, since these mostly represent temporary reroutings due to construction work or special trips for operational reasons (e.g. ending a trip at a depot at the end of a day). Remember, this does not mean that e.g. a single bus line connects the two stops four times a day, but _ALL_ direct bus connections exceed four operations a day _on average_.

    ```cypher
    {triples_queries["Routes serving stops"]}
    {triples_queries["Mode of transport of each route"]}
    ```

    Similarly as for the connection relations before, we discard some noise. In this case, we only consider a route to serve a particular stop if it stops there at least once per day on average.

    ### Geographic Location

    Since the embedding model has no idea about Vienna's geography, we should represent the idea of proximity in our training data. 

    ```cypher
    {triples_queries["Stop locations in/nearby subdistricts"]}
    {triples_queries["Neighbouring subdistricts"]}
    {triples_queries["Geographic proximity of stops"]}
    ```

    ### Population Density

    In addition to knowing which stops serve which district, it is also paramount to know their population density to estimate the demand for public transport. Ideally, the embedding model will draw the conclusion that high-density subdistricts need frequent transit connections. 

    ```cypher
    {triples_queries["Classify districts by density"]}
    ```

    ### Level of Service

    Lastly, we categorize connections between stops regarding their frequency of operation. This complements the information about the type of connection (mode of transport) we gave earlier and hopefully correlates with population density.

    ```cypher
    {triples_queries["Classify connections by frequency"]}
    ```
